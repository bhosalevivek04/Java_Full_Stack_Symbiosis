OOPS Pillar

OOPS Concepts:
    1. Encapsulation: Binding data and methods that manipulate that data into a single unit.
        - making properties privtate and exposing behavior by using accessor and mutator

    2. Abstraction: Hiding internal implementation details and showing only necessary information to the outside world.
    3. Inheritance: Creating a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behavior.
    4. Polymorphism: Ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used.
