Access Specifiers in Java

This document provides an overview of access specifiers in Java, which are crucial for encapsulation in object-oriented programming. Java has four types of access specifiers:

1. Public: Accessible from any other class in any package.
2. Private: Accessible only within the class it is declared in.
3. Protected: Accessible within the same package and in subclasses.
4. Default: Accessible only within classes in the same package (no specifier).

## Summary of Access Specifiers

- Public: Least restrictive; members are accessible everywhere.
- Private: Most restrictive; members are accessible only within the class.
- Protected: Accessible in the same package and subclasses.
- Default: Accessible only within the same package.

Understanding these access specifiers helps in protecting sensitive data and ensuring better modularity in code design.
