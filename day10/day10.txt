Day 10 - Static and Final Keywords in Java

1. Static Keyword:
   - Used to create class-level variables and methods.
   - Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.
   - Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.

2. Final Keyword:
   - Used to declare constants, methods that cannot be overridden, and classes that cannot be inherited.
   - A final variable can only be initialized once and cannot be reassigned.

3. Examples:
   - Utility Class: Contains static methods for math operations and a final static constant for PI.
   - Employee Management: Uses static variables to track the number of employee instances and a final variable for retirement age.

4. Key Takeaways:
   - Static members belong to the class, not instances.
   - Final members cannot be changed after initialization.
