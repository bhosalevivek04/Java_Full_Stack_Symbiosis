Key Interfaces in Collection Framework
    - Collection: Represents a group of objects as a single entity.

    - Map: An object that maps keys to values.

Implementations of Collection Framework
    - ArrayList: A resizable array implementation of the List interface.
    - LinkedList: A doubly-linked list implementation of the List interface.
    - HashSet: A hash table-based implementation of the Set interface.
    - HashMap: A hash table-based implementation of the Map interface.

Benefits of Collection Framework
    - Provides a common interface for different types of collections.
    - Allows for easy iteration over collections.
    - Supports operations such as add, remove, and search.
    - Enhances code reusability and flexibility.
